# Introduction

Yet Another World Protector, or YAWP for short, is a server-side mod which allows you to protect your creations against
various different events/actions of players, mobs and the environment. It was inspired by the forge
mod [WorldProtector](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldprotector) and
the [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) plugin.

***The mod is currently in its beta state, with many features not yet implemented but to come. These features will
include most of the things you know from WorldProtector and WorldGuard.***

This mod will be released for Minecraft versions 1.16.5+. If you are living in the past and are looking for a version
for Minecraft 1.12.2, I suggest looking into
using [WorldDefender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-defender).
