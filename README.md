# Yet Another World Protector

Yet Another World Protector (YAWP) is _the_ admin tool to protect your minecraft server (dedicated or LAN as well as
single-player!).

YAWP designed to be used on dedicated servers, but can also be used in single player worlds and worlds opened to LAN.
It allows admins (and players with assigned permission) to protect their creations against various events/actions of
players, mobs and the environment.

Create regions for your builds and apply region flags to protect them.
Assign players or vanilla teams to regions, so they can manage their own regions.

YAWP was inspired by the forge mod [WorldProtector](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldprotector) and
the [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) plugin.

## Supported Versions

This mod is available for Minecraft versions 1.16.5+ for (Neo-) Forge and Fabric.

Starting with Minecraft **1.20.4**, YAWP will no longer be available for Forge and adapt **NeoForge** instead.
